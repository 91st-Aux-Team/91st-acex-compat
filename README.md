# 91st-acex-compat

This is the 91st ACEX Compat.
This repository is out of date as the mod has been moved into the main mod, however this is still a working version of the mod and will remain open source as a library for other units to use to base their own compat.

Addons > 91st_Glasses > config.pp has comments within the code which explains very briefly what each attribute represents. More attributes exist but can be seen from the ACEAX Compat supplied by the ACE Extended Aresenal team.

Any further questions can be sent to the 91st MRC Aux Team.
